## How I manage my vim plugins 
Vim 8 introduced native package management, and that is what I use. [Here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/) you can find a good tutorial on how to set it up with `git submodule`. I currently use the path [~/.vim/pack/sampo/start](.vim/pack/sampo/start) for all plugins.
